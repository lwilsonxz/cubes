Assignment 4 for my computer graphics class.

Assignment4's goal was simply to render a number of moving objects and provide lighting. The movement of the objects is slightly bugged, as they collide with surfaces only at their centers, not their edges, but the basic functionality of the code is fairly straightforward. The shader code itself is a little messy, since it was the first time I had ever written shader code. In retrospect, a for-loop would have been a little more elegant. The greatest challenges with this project were constructing and animating models, as well as creating functional lighting using shader code.
